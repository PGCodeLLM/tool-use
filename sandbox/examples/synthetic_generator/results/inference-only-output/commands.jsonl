They want to update the permissions so the owner can execute it, while others can only read it. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that file permissions in Unix are set using chmod. The owner needs execute permission, so that's +x for the owner. But others should only have read permission. Wait, what about the group? The question doesn't mention group permissions. Maybe the group can have read and execute, but the user wants others (which typically refers to everyone else not in the group) to only read. Hmm.\n\nWait, the question says \"others can only read it.\" So others should have read permission, but not execute. But the owner needs execute. So the permissions should be like this: owner has read, write, execute; group might have read and execute, but the user didn't specify. Wait, the user didn't mention group permissions. Maybe the group can have read and execute, but others can only read. Or maybe the group is not specified, and the user just wants to set owner and others. Let me check the exact wording.\n\nThe user says: \"the owner can execute it, while others can only read it.\" So others (the 'other' category) should have read, but not execute. The owner should have execute. But what about the group? The user didn't mention group permissions. So maybe the group can have read and execute, but the user didn't specify. Or perhaps the group is not considered here. Wait, the default permissions for a script might be different. But the user is specifically asking to set owner and others. So perhaps the group is not being modified here. \n\nWait, the standard way to set permissions is using octal notation. Let me think. The owner needs execute, so that's 1 in the owner's position. Others need read, which is 4. So for others, 4. But what about the group? The user didn't mention group. So maybe we should leave the group as it is, or set it to read and execute? Wait, the user says \"others can only read it.\" So others (the 'other' category) should have read, but not execute. So the permissions would be:\n\nOwner: rwx (7)\nGroup: ??? The user didn't specify, but maybe the group can have read and execute? Or maybe the user wants the group to have the same as others? Wait, the user's instruction is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the question.\n\n\"Update its permissions so that the owner can execute it, while others can only read it.\"\n\nSo the owner can execute (so execute permission for owner), and others can only read. So others have read (4), but not execute. The group's permissions are not specified. So perhaps the group can have read and execute, or maybe the user wants to leave the group as is. But the user might not have considered the group. However, the problem statement doesn't mention the group, so perhaps the group's permissions are left unchanged. But maybe the user wants to ensure that the group can't execute? Or maybe the group is not part of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to set the permissions so that the owner has execute, and others have read, but the group is not specified. So, perhaps the correct way is to set the owner's permissions to 7 (rwx), others to 4 (r--), and group to whatever it was before. But how to do that with chmod?\n\nThe command would be to add execute for the owner and remove execute for others. Wait, the current permissions might not have execute for the owner. So the user needs to add execute for the owner and ensure that others don't have execute. So the command would be something like:\n\nchmod u+x,o-rx deploy.sh\n\nWait, let me check. The current permissions may not have execute for the owner, so adding execute for the owner. Then, others should have read only. So, for others, we need to remove execute. So the command would be:\n\nchmod u+x,o-rx deploy.sh\n\nBut let me think again. The original permissions might have others with read and execute. So to set others to read only, we need to remove execute. So the command would be:\n\nchmod u+x,o-rx deploy.sh\n\nBut maybe the user wants to set the permissions to 744? Wait, 744 is owner has rwx, group and others have r--. But that would mean others can't execute. But the user says \"others can only read it\". So that's exactly 744. Wait, 744 is owner: rwx, group: r--, others: r--. So that would mean others can read, but not execute. So that's what the user wants. But the user also says \"the owner can execute it\". So that's covered by 744. But what about the group? If the group has read and execute, then the group can execute. But the user didn't mention the group. So perhaps the user wants to set the group to have read only, but that's not specified. But the problem statement says \"others can only read it\", which refers to the 'other' category, not the group. So the group's permissions are not specified, so maybe we should leave them as they are. But if the user wants to set the group to have read only, then we need to adjust that. However, the problem statement doesn't mention the group, so perhaps the correct approach is to set the owner to have execute, and others to have read, while leaving the group as is. But how to do that with chmod?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to set the permissions to 744, which would set owner to rwx, group and others to r--. But that would make the group have read only, which might not be intended. However, the user didn't mention the group, so maybe that's acceptable. Let me check the question again. The user says \"others can only read it.\" So others (the 'other' category) should have read, but not execute. The group is a separate category. So the user might not care about group permissions. But if the script is in /usr/local/bin, which is usually owned by root, then the group might be root. But the user is asking to set the owner's permissions. \n\nWait, the user says \"the owner can execute it, while others can only read it.\" So the owner has execute, others (non-owner and non-group) have read. So the group's permissions are not specified. So the correct way is to set the owner to have execute, and others to have read, but not modify the group. However, how to do that with chmod? The command would be to add execute for the owner and remove execute for others. So:\n\nchmod u+x,o-rx deploy.sh\n\nBut let me check. The 'o-rx' would remove execute and write for others? Wait, no. The 'o-rx' would remove read and execute? Wait, no. The syntax is: the options are u, g, o, and then the permissions. For example, 'u+x' adds execute for the owner. 'o-rx' would remove read and execute from others. Wait, no. The 'o-rx' would remove the read and execute permissions? Or is it that 'o-rx' is removing the read and execute? Let me think. The syntax for chmod is that each permission is specified with a letter. For example, to remove execute from others, you would use 'o-x'. To remove read and execute, you would use 'o-rx'? Wait, no. The correct way is to specify the permission you want to remove. For example, to remove execute from others, it's 'o-x'. To remove read from others, it's 'o-r'. But if you want to set others to have only read, you need to remove execute and write. Wait, but the original permissions might have others with read and write. So to set others to have only read, you need to remove write and execute. But the user says \"others can only read it\", which implies that others can't write or execute. So the command would be:\n\nchmod u+x,o-rwx deploy.sh\n\nWait, but that would remove all permissions from others except read. Wait, no. The 'o-rwx' would remove all permissions (read, write, execute) from others, which is not what we want. Because the user wants others to have read only. So the correct way is to set others to have read, but not write or execute. So to do that, we can use 'o=r' (set others to read only). But how to do that in a single command.\n\nAlternatively, if the current permissions for others have read and execute, we need to remove execute. So the command would be:\n\nchmod u+x,o-x deploy.sh\n\nThat would add execute for the owner and remove execute for others. But what if others had write permissions? The user didn't mention that. The question says \"others can only read it\", which implies that others can't write or execute. So perhaps the original permissions for others might have write. So we need to remove write and execute from others. But how to do that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to set the permissions to 744, which is owner: rwx, group: r--, others: r--.

The user wants to check all executable files in /usr/local/bin and list those with permissions not matching 755 into /tmp/invalid_perms.txt.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to find executable files. In Unix, executable files usually have the x bit set. So maybe using find with -executable or checking the permissions. Wait, the -executable option in find might not be reliable because it checks if the file is executable by the current user, which might not be the case for all users. Alternatively, checking the permissions directly.\n\nThe user wants files that are executable, so perhaps using find with -perm to check the permissions.

So maybe using find with -type f and -perm /u+x, but maybe the user is considering all files that are executable, not just those with the x bit set in the user's permissions. Hmm, but the problem says \"executable files\", so perhaps it's better to check if the file is executable, regardless of the user's permissions. Wait, but the question is about their permissions, not whether they are executable by the user. So maybe the correct approach is to find all files in /usr/local/bin, check their permissions, and see if they match 755.\n\nWait, the problem says \"permissions not matching '755'\". So the user is interested in files that have permissions other than 755. But the user also says \"executable files\", so perhaps they want to check only files that are executable. Wait, but maybe the user is considering all files in /usr/local/bin, but only those that are executable. Or maybe they want to check all files, regardless of being executable, but the ones that are executable and have permissions not 755. The wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nLet me re-read the question: \"List files with permissions not matching '755' to '/tmp/invalid_perms.txt'.\" So maybe the user wants to check all files in /usr/local/bin, regardless of being executable, but those whose permissions are not exactly 755. But the first part says \"executable files\", so perhaps they want to check only executable files. Wait, the original question says: \"verify the permissions of all executable files in '/usr/local/bin'\". So first, find all executable files in that directory, then check their permissions. So the steps are: find all executable files in /usr/local/bin, then check if their permissions are not 755, and list them in the file.\n\nSo first, find executable files. How to do that? Using find with -executable. But that might not be reliable. Alternatively, check the permissions. For example, using find with -perm /u+x to find files where the user has execute permission, which is necessary for a file to be executable. But maybe the user is considering that a file is executable if it has the x bit set in any of the user, group, or others. But the standard way to find executable files is to check if the file has the execute bit set for any of the three categories. However, the problem says \"executable files\", which might mean that the file is executable by the user, but that's not the same as the permissions. So perhaps the user is considering all files that are executable (i.e., have the x bit set in any of the three categories). So to find those, we can use find /usr/local/bin -type f -perm /u+x -o -perm /g+x -o -perm /o+x. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, using -executable in find. But I think the correct way is to check for the presence of the execute bit in any of the user, group, or others. So using find with -perm /u+x, -perm /g+x, or -perm /o+x. But perhaps the simplest way is to use -executable, which checks if the file is executable by the current user. But that might not be accurate. For example, a file that has the x bit set in the user's permissions but not in the group or others, but the user is not the owner. However, the user is probably looking for files that are executable in the sense that they have the x bit set in any of the three categories. So maybe the correct approach is to use find with -perm /u+x, -perm /g+x, or -perm /o+x. But that's a bit messy. Alternatively, using -perm -u+x to check if the user has execute permission. Wait, the -perm test in find can be a bit tricky. The -perm /u+x means that the file has the execute bit set for the user. So if we want to find files that are executable (i.e., have the x bit set in any of the three), perhaps we can use -perm /u+x -o -perm /g+x -o -perm /o+x. But that's a lot of options. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering that an executable file is one that has the x bit set in the user's permission, which is the common case. But maybe the user is not specific. However, the problem states \"executable files\", so maybe it's better to use -executable. But I'm not sure. Let's assume that the user wants to check all files that are executable (i.e., have the x bit set in any of the three categories). So, perhaps using find /usr/local/bin -type f -perm /u+x -o -perm /g+x -o -perm /o+x. But that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering that a file is executable if it's marked as such, regardless of the user's permissions. So, perhaps using find with -perm /u+x to check for user execute permission. But that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the user is not concerned about the actual executable status and just wants to check all files in /usr/local/bin, but that seems unlikely. The question is a bit ambiguous, but given the context of a system audit, it's likely that they want to check all files that are executable (i.e., have the x bit set in any of the three categories). \n\nSo, the first step is to find all executable files in /usr/local/bin. Then, check their permissions. The permissions are to be checked against 755. So, the files that are not exactly 755. So, for each executable file, we need to check if their permissions are not exactly 755. \n\nNow, how to check the permissions. The find command can use -perm to check. But the -perm option can be used with a specific mode. For example, -perm 755 would match files with exactly that permission. However, the problem is that the user wants files that do not match 755. So, we need to find files that do not have exactly 755 permissions. \n\nBut how to do that in find. The find command doesn't have a direct way to negate the permission check. So, perhaps using -not -perm 755. But that would match files that do not have exactly 755 permissions. However, this might include files that have other permissions, like 750, 777, etc. \n\nBut wait, the user wants to list files with permissions not matching 755. So, the correct approach is to find all executable files, and then check if their permissions are not exactly 755. \n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Find all executable files in /usr/local/bin. Let's assume that executable files are those with the x bit set in any of the three categories. So using find /usr/local/bin -type f -perm /u+x -o -perm /g+x -o -perm /o+x.\n\nBut that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, using -executable, which checks if the file is executable by the current user. However, this might not be accurate. For example, a file that has execute permissions for others but the current user is not in the group. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering that an executable file is one that has the x bit set in the user's permission. So, using find /usr/local/bin -type f -perm /u+x. But that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is not concerned about the actual executable status and just wants to check all files in /usr/local/bin. But the question says \"executable files\", so it's better to check for that. \n\nBut perhaps the simplest way is to use find /usr/local/bin -type f -executable.

However, this might not be reliable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering that a file is executable if it has the x bit set in the user's permission.
